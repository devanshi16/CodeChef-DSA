### Complexity Analysis + Basics Warm Up
1. **[Life, Universe and Everything](https://www.codechef.com/LRNDSA01/problems/TEST)** (test.py) - Rewrite small numbers from input to output. Stop processing input after reading in the number 42. All numbers at input are integers of one or two digits.

2. **[Reverse the Number](https://www.codechef.com/LRNDSA01/problems/FLOW007)** (reverse-number.py) - If an Integer N, write a program to reverse the given number.

3. **[Lapindromes](https://www.codechef.com/LRNDSA01/problems/LAPIN)** (lapindrome.py) - Lapindrome is defined as a string which when split in the middle, gives two halves having the same characters and same frequency of each character. Your task is simple. Given a string, you need to tell if it is a lapindrome.

4. **[Smart Phone](https://www.codechef.com/LRNDSA01/problems/ZCO14003)** (smartphone.py) - You are developing a smartphone app. You have a list of potential customers for your app. Each customer has a budget and will buy the app at your declared price if and only if the price is less than or equal to the customer's budget. You want to fix a price so that the revenue you earn from the app is maximized. Find this maximum possible revenue.

5. **[Carvans](https://www.codechef.com/LRNDSA01/problems/CARVANS)** (carvans.py) - Formally, you're given the maximum speed of N cars in the order they entered the long straight segment of the circuit. Each car prefers to move at its maximum speed. If that's not possible because of the front car being slow, it might have to lower its speed. It still moves at the fastest possible speed while avoiding any collisions. For the purpose of this problem, you can assume that the straight segment is infinitely long. Count the number of cars which were moving at their maximum speed on the straight segment.

6. **[Coin Flip](https://www.codechef.com/LRNDSA01/problems/CONFLIP)** (coin-flip.py) - This game the player will use N coins numbered from 1 to N, and all the coins will be facing in "Same direction" (Either Head or Tail),which will be decided by the player before starting of the game. The player needs to play N rounds.In the k-th round the player will flip the face of the all coins whose number is less than or equal to k. That is, the face of coin i will be reversed, from Head to Tail, or, from Tail to Head, for i â‰¤ k. Guess the total number of coins showing a particular face after playing N rounds. 

7. **[Laddu](https://www.codechef.com/LRNDSA01/problems/LADDU)** (laddu.py) - Let us know about various activities and amount of laddus you get corresponding to them.
